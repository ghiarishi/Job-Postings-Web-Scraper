# Job Postings Web Scraper

Job Postings Web Scraper is a Python-based tool designed to scrape job listings from Lever and Greenhouse job boards. It retrieves job titles, company names, locations, and job descriptions based on user-defined criteria and saves the results into an Excel file with separate sheets for relevant and potentially relevant job postings.

## Features

- Perform Google searches to find job postings on Lever and Greenhouse job boards.
- Filter jobs based on user-specified roles and time periods.
- Retrieve detailed job information including company name, job title, location, and job description.
- Save job listings to an Excel file with timestamps for easy tracking and review.
- Remove duplicate job listings and sort results alphabetically by company name.

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`) OR Docker

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:

```

### Approach 1

1. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python jobScraper.py
   ```

### Approach 2
1. Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine

2. Build the Docker Image: 
```sh
docker build -t job-scraper-container .
```

3. Run the Docker Image: 
```
sh
docker run -it -v "C:/Users/ghiar/Rishi Ghia/Personal Projects/job-scraper/data:/data" job-scraper-container
```

## Usage: 
1. Input the required information:
   - Number of results to fetch: Enter 'max' to fetch as many results as possible or an integer to specify the exact number.
   - Time period for the results: Specify 'h' for hour, 'd' for day, 'w' for week, 'm' for month, or 'y' for year.
   - Roles of interest: Specify roles like 'sde' (Software Development Engineer), 'aiml' (AI/ML), 'cv' (Computer Vision), 'nlp' (Natural Language Processing), 'robo' (Robotics), or 'all' for all roles.

2. Review the results:
   - The script will fetch and display the number of job listings retrieved, remove duplicates, and show the number of relevant and potentially relevant job postings.

4. Output:
   - The job listings will be saved to an Excel file named in the format `jobListings-<timePeriod>-<HH-MM, DD-MM-YYYY>.xlsx` with two sheets: 'Relevant Jobs' and 'Relevant (Maybe) Jobs', stored in the 'data' directory.
